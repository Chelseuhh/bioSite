                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Sarah Grace—a passionate freelance photographer based in Raleigh, NC. I specialize in capturing stunning visuals that tell unique, authentic stories. My journey into photography began at a young age, and I haven’t looked back since.
                    <br><br>
                    I graduated from Randolph Community College's renowned Photography Program, where I had the privilege of participating in the Early College Program. This experience gave me a strong foundation, and I've been building my portfolio ever since. My work spans various genres, from portraiture to landscapes, and everything in between, all with a keen eye for detail and a focus on capturing the beauty of the moment.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to my photography career, I am also the proud co-owner of UAV Mobile Station LLC, a company specializing in drone services. This venture allows me to combine my love for technology, adventure, and the outdoors, providing aerial photography and videography for clients across multiple industries.
                    <br><br>
                    Although I was raised in North Carolina, my roots trace back to Florida, and I've also spent time living in Colorado. These experiences have shaped my deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors. Hiking, exploring, and traveling are some of my greatest passions, and they play an essential role in both my personal life and my work as a photographer.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology at NC State University, with a focus on land management and conservation projects. I am passionate about applying my skills in the field to protect and preserve the natural world, and I see my photography as a tool to document these efforts. Whether it’s capturing the beauty of a landscape or telling the stories of wildlife conservation, I strive to use my craft to raise awareness and inspire change.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not behind the lens or working on my conservation studies, you can find me exploring new places, hiking in the wilderness, or traveling to feed my curiosity about the world around me.
